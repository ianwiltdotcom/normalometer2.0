# normalometer2.0
Brandywine High School Engineering devices for visualizing physics, redesigned from "version 1.0" by [Wagner Labs](http://www.wagnerlabs.net/NormalProject/) and designed with components by [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com).

The original device was created as a way for physics students to visualize the normal forces acting upon an apparatus, while encouraging students studying physics, engineering and computer science to experiment with the device.

"Version 2.0" updates the original design of the Normalometer with a more powerful processor, a better display, easier assembly, lower cost and host more advanced features, such as data logging. Running CircuitPython, it is designed to be even more hackable, allowing students to review the code and make changes on-the-fly.

## Assembly Instructions

See [ASSEMBLY.md](ASSEMBLY.md)

## Installation

Ensure the device is running CircuitPython 6.0 or newer. Clone this repository and copy it into `CIRCUITPY`.
